I'm Federico, your average italian programmer 🍝, huge MTG nerd since 2014 🧙 

I'm a frontend developer pecialized in creating complex design systems, mainly working with TailwindCSS and NextJS, but i love studying new technologies and keep myself up to date.

I'm currently moving out of my comfort zone, studying backend development and the NixOS environment.

Thanks for visiting! ❄️
