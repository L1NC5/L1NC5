I'm Federico, your average italian programmer 🍝, huge MTG nerd since 2014 🧙 

I deal mainly with HTML/CSS with some basic JavaScript knowledge on the side, 
while also getting my hands dirty modifying some Angular/Laravel/PHP projects.

I'm currently trying to learn AngularJS to expand my skillset, so i can become a more complete front-end developer!
